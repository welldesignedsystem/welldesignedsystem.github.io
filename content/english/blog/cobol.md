COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language created for business data processing, especially on mainframes. It is known for its English-like syntax and is widely used in industries such as banking, insurance and government for batch and transaction processing. This guide provides an overview of COBOL, its features, structure and key concepts, helping developers understand and work with COBOL programs, especially in the context of mainframe systems.

## What is COBOL?
COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language designed for business data processing, especially on mainframes. It is widely used in banking, insurance and government systems for batch and transaction processing.

## Key Features
- **English-like Syntax:** COBOL code is verbose and reads like English, making it easy to understand.
- **Procedural Language:** COBOL is primarily procedural, focusing on step-by-step instructions.
- **Strong Data Processing:** Excellent for handling large volumes of data and batch processing.
- **Legacy Systems:** Many critical systems still run on COBOL, especially on mainframes.

## COBOL vs Java
| Aspect         | COBOL                          | Java                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Syntax         | Verbose, English-like          | Concise, C-like       |
| Paradigm       | Procedural                    | Object-Oriented       |
| Platform       | Mainframes, legacy systems     | Cross-platform (JVM)  |
| Use Cases      | Business, finance, batch jobs  | Web, mobile, desktop  |

## Mainframe Context & File Types

- **COBOL Programs**:
  - Source code files (`.cob`, `.cbl`) written in COBOL containing business logic and data processing. Comparable to `.java` or `.py` files. 
- **Copybooks**:
  - Reusable code or data structure snippets (`.cpy`), included in COBOL programs using the `COPY` statement. Analogous to Java imports or Python modules, often used for shared data definitions (e.g., record layouts).
- **JCL Scripts**:
  - Job Control Language files (`.jcl`) are Scripts used to run and schedule COBOL programs on mainframes. JCL is similar to shell scripts or Windows batch files, controlling program execution, input/output files and job sequencing.
- **Datasets**: 
  - Files or databases on the mainframe, used to store input/output data. Datasets can be sequential files (like CSVs), VSAM files (indexed), or DB2 tables (relational). Analogous to files or SQL tables in Java applications.
- **Utilities**: 
  - System tools or programs for common tasks such as file copying, sorting, or data conversion. Examples include `IEBGENER` (copy files), `SORT` (sort data) and `IDCAMS` (manage VSAM datasets). These are similar to Unix command-line utilities like `cp`, `sort`, or `awk`.

## Basic Structure of a COBOL Program

A COBOL program is divided into four main divisions, each with specific sections or subsections:

- **IDENTIFICATION DIVISION**
  - Contains program metadata (name, author, etc.).
  - (no sections) Program metadata (name, author, etc.)
- **ENVIRONMENT DIVISION**
  - Specifies system/environment settings, such as file assignments.
  - Types of sections:
    - CONFIGURATION SECTION: System-dependent settings (SOURCE-COMPUTER, SPECIAL-NAMES)
    - INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION: File assignments and control (FILE-CONTROL, I-O-CONTROL)
- **DATA DIVISION**
  - Defines data structures and files used in the program.
  - Types of sections:
    - FILE SECTION: File record layouts
    - WORKING-STORAGE SECTION: Program variables (persistent for program duration)
    - LOCAL-STORAGE SECTION: Variables with local scope (reset on each call)
    - LINKAGE SECTION: Data passed from other programs or calling routines
- **PROCEDURE DIVISION**
  - Contains the executable logic (similar to Java methods/main).
  - (no sections) Executable program logic

## Key Concepts & Terminology
- **Mainframe Terms vs Java Terms**:
  | Mainframe/COBOL      | Java Equivalent                |
  |----------------------|-------------------------------|
  | Program (COBOL)      | Class or main method          |
  | Copybook             | Import/module/shared class     |
  | JCL                  | Shell script/Batch file       |
  | Dataset              | File/Database table           |
  | Utility (SORT, etc.) | Command-line tool/Library     |

- **Other Concepts**:
  - **Batch Processing**: COBOL is often used for batch jobs—processing large volumes of data in scheduled runs, similar to Java batch frameworks (e.g., Spring Batch).
  - **CICS**: Customer Information Control System, a transaction processing system for online COBOL programs (not covered in detail here).
  - **EJECT Directive**: A compiler directive used to start a new page in the source code listing for improved readability and organization. It does not affect program execution. Example usage:
  ```cobol
  EJECT
  * This section starts on a new page in the listing
  ```

## COBOL Keywords

In COBOL, keywords (reserved words) are predefined words that have special meaning to the compiler. You cannot use them as variable names or identifiers. They define structure, actions, or data descriptions. Here are the main categories of COBOL keywords, organized for clarity:

### 1. Program Structure Keywords
| Keyword                | Purpose                                         |

## COBOL Data Types & Variables

- **Elementary Types**:
  - `PIC 9(n)`: Numeric (e.g., `PIC 9(5)` = 5-digit integer, like `int`).
  - `PIC X(n)`: Alphanumeric (e.g., `PIC X(10)` = 10-char string).
  - `PIC S9(n)V99`: Signed decimal with implied decimal (e.g., `S9(5)V99` = signed with 2 decimals).
- **Group Items**: Like structs or objects, grouping fields.
  ```cobol
  01 EMPLOYEE-REC.
     05 EMP-ID      PIC 9(5).
     05 EMP-NAME    PIC X(20).
  ```
- **Arrays**: `OCCURS` clause (like arrays/lists).
  ```cobol
  01 EMP-TABLE.
     05 EMP-REC OCCURS 10 TIMES.
        10 EMP-ID   PIC 9(5).
        10 EMP-NAME PIC X(20).
  ```

## File I/O in COBOL

- **File Declaration** (in ENVIRONMENT and DATA DIVISION):
  ```cobol
  ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
  INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
  FILE-CONTROL.
      SELECT INFILE ASSIGN TO 'input.txt'.

  DATA DIVISION.
  FILE SECTION.
  FD  INFILE.
  01  IN-REC PIC X(100).
  ```
- **File Operations** (in PROCEDURE DIVISION):
  ```cobol
  OPEN INPUT INFILE
  READ INFILE INTO IN-REC
      AT END DISPLAY "EOF"
  CLOSE INFILE
  ```

---

## Copybooks

- **Purpose**: Share data layouts or code across programs.
- **Usage**:
  ```cobol
  COPY 'EMPLOYEE-REC'.
  ```
- **Analogy**: Like `import` in Python/Java, or `#include` in C.

---

## JCL (Job Control Language)

- **Purpose**: Run COBOL programs, define datasets, sequence jobs.
- **Example**:
  ```jcl
  //JOBNAME  JOB (ACCT),'DESC'
  //STEP1    EXEC PGM=SAMPLE-PROGRAM
  //INFILE   DD  DSN=INPUT.DATASET,DISP=SHR
  //OUTFILE  DD  DSN=OUTPUT.DATASET,DISP=NEW
  ```
- **Analogy**: Like a shell script or batch file that runs your program and manages files.

---

## Datasets

- **Sequential**: Like a text file or CSV.
- **VSAM**: Indexed files, like a key-value store.
- **DB2**: Relational database tables.

---

## Utilities

- **IEBGENER**: Copy files (like `cp`).
- **SORT**: Sort data (like Unix `sort`).
- **IDCAMS**: Manage VSAM datasets.

---

## Migration Tips for Java/Python/JS Developers

- **Data Types**: Map COBOL types to Java/Python types (`PIC 9(5)` → `int`, `PIC X(10)` → `String`).
- **Batch Logic**: COBOL batch jobs → Java (Spring Batch), Python (Pandas), JS (streams).
- **File I/O**: COBOL sequential files → Java `BufferedReader`, Python `open()`, JS file APIs.
- **Copybooks**: Convert to shared classes/modules.
- **JCL**: Replace with scripts, workflow tools, or job schedulers.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests to match COBOL output with new code.

---

## Getting Started

- **COBOL Compilers:** OpenCOBOL (GnuCOBOL), IBM COBOL.
- **Try Online:** [Online COBOL Compiler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cobol_online.php)
- **Sample Project**: Start with a simple COBOL program, parse its structure and try mapping it to Java/Python.
