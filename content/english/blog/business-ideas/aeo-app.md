## Ideas

lets plan - i want to build the following - a portal that will

1. show me the top 10 competitors for my business
2. our market share - based on various factor you can find e.g. revenue info in the net, traffic etc.. (you can suggest the full list)
3. traffic, usage from organic and paid for the business based on website. (differentiate paid channels)
4. usage/popularity among customers based on country for the business
5. top 20 keywords and prompts to target for this business after comparing with top competitors in the business
6. Find out how can i improve my rankings / visibility for those 20 keywords
7. Find out my profiles in linkedin, fb, insta, x, and major platforms and suggest the improvements
8. Based on the finding automate task to improve my ranking
9. Back links - identify related sites / blogs and put comment / add links to my product
10. compare and use results from all SEO,AEO and GEO - google.com, bing, chatgpt, copilot etc.
11. analyse my current website and generate a report.

lets build a plan, roadmap, tell me the modules for this project. in markdown. I am planning to do it in AI using agents skills etc... and make it a portal

## 1. The Problem

> _The Unified SEO · AEO · GEO Intelligence Platform_

For three decades, the game was simple: rank on Google, get to page one, earn clicks. That era isn't over — but it's no longer the whole story.

When someone searches "what's the best way to treat a mild burn at home?" they often don't click a single link. They read the answer directly from Google's AI Overview, Bing Copilot, Perplexity, or ChatGPT. The question is answered _before_ the user reaches your website.

**The question is no longer just "Can I rank #1?" — it's "Can I be the source that AI cites, quotes, or summarises?"**

```mermaid

    D --> F["💀 SEO alone = Invisible\nNew tools needed"]

    style F fill:#991b1b,stroke:#dc2626,color:#fff
```

Over 60% of Google searches now end without a click (Sparktoro/Semrush data). If your content isn't _the answer_, you receive no traffic even from searches you technically rank for. Existing tools — Semrush, Ahrefs, Moz — were built for the pre-LLM era and measure the wrong thing: link rankings. https://aeo-app.ai measures what actually matters in 2026: **who gets quoted when AI answers a question**.

---

## 2. Core Concepts: SEO, AEO, and GEO

### The Three Layers

Think of these as layers of the same stack, not competing strategies:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph GEO["🌐 GEO — Optimise for AI-generated responses"]
        subgraph AEO["💡 AEO — Optimise for direct answers"]
            subgraph SEO["🔗 SEO — Optimise for link rankings"]
            end
        end
    end

    style GEO fill:#7979F2,stroke:#e94560,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    style AEO fill:#9999F2,stroke:#0f3460,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    style SEO fill:#B4B4F0,stroke:#533483,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
```

**SEO** remains the foundation. If Google can't crawl and index your page, no AI system will find it either. Technical SEO, backlinks, on-page signals, and Google's E-E-A-T framework (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) all feed the inputs that AEO and GEO build on.

**AEO** (Answer Engine Optimisation) layers on top by ensuring content is structured for extraction — clear questions, concise answers, proper schema markup, and voice-search readiness. AEO targets systems designed to directly respond to user queries rather than return a list of links, including: Google AI Overviews, Bing/Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity AI, Apple Intelligence, voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri), Featured Snippets, People Also Ask (PAA) boxes, and Knowledge Panels.

**GEO** (Generative Engine Optimisation) goes furthest by optimising for the generative layer — building authoritative content with the depth, citations, statistics, and credibility signals that LLMs are trained to privilege. GEO targets: Perplexity AI, ChatGPT Search, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Claude, Meta AI, You.com, and Grok. The term was formally introduced in a 2023 research paper from Princeton, Georgia Tech, The Allen Institute for AI, and IIT Delhi.

**You don't choose one. You do all three.** Tactics at each level reinforce the others.

### AEO vs GEO: The Subtle Difference

While people often use these terms interchangeably, there's a meaningful distinction:

| Dimension      | AEO                                         | GEO                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Focus          | Being the _direct answer_ to a query        | Being _cited or synthesised_ by an AI response |
| Engine type    | Structured retrieval (snippets, PAA, voice) | Generative LLM outputs                         |
| Content format | Clear Q&A, definitions, lists               | Authoritative depth, citations, statistics     |
| Origin         | Pre-LLM era (voice search, snippets)        | Post-2022 (GPT-4, AI Search era)               |
| Measurement    | Featured snippet wins, zero-click share     | AI citation frequency, mention volume          |

---

## 3. How AI Search Works

### Featured Snippets (Traditional AEO)

Google's snippet system: (1) parses query intent type, (2) retrieves top-ranked pages, (3) extracts the most relevant passage, (4) displays it directly in the SERP. Key insight: Google often pulls snippets from pages ranked 2nd–5th if their formatting more clearly answers the query. **Structure beats pure authority.**

### Google AI Overviews & Generative Engines

Both use a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline:

1. **Query understanding** — interpret intent, entities, and required response type
2. **Web retrieval** — retrieve live results (Perplexity crawls in real time; ChatGPT Search uses Bing)
3. **Passage ranking & chunking** — documents broken into 200–500 token chunks, ranked for relevance
4. **Generative synthesis** — LLM reads chunks and generates a cited response
5. **Citation attribution** — source visibility depends on retrieval score and LLM preference during synthesis

A page ranked #15 organically can still appear in an AI Overview if it contains the most precisely structured answer to a component of the query.

### What Makes an LLM Prefer Your Content

Research from the original GEO paper found the following tactics increased citation frequency:

| Tactic                                               | Citation visibility increase |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Citing authoritative sources within your own content | +40%                         |
| Adding expert quotations                             | +34%                         |
| Including specific statistics                        | +27%                         |
| Using technical, domain-specific vocabulary          | +13%                         |
| Fluent, readable prose                               | +17%                         |
| Persuasive language and strong claims                | +11%                         |

### Voice Search & Smart Assistants

Voice assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa) typically pull from featured snippets (primary source), Knowledge Graph entries, structured data/schema markup, and trusted local data. Voice answers are almost always **a single, short spoken response** — meaning clarity and conciseness matter enormously.

---

## 4. Why This Matters Now

- Perplexity grew from 10M to 100M+ monthly queries in under 18 months
- ChatGPT Search launched to 100M+ users in 2024 and expanded rapidly through 2025
- Google AI Overviews now appear for over 15% of all queries and rising
- Microsoft Copilot handles hundreds of millions of queries monthly
- Smart speakers are in over 35% of homes in the US and Australia — each voice query has exactly one answer
- Even without a click, AI citations build brand awareness: users see your domain, associate your brand with authority, and drive direct/branded traffic

## 6. AEO: Complete How-To Guide

### Step 1: Question-Based Keyword Research

Target questions and intent, not just keywords. Sources: AnswerThePublic, AlsoAsked, Google PAA boxes, Semrush/Ahrefs question filters, Reddit/Quora, and your own Search Console data.

| Intent Type         | Example Query                         | Optimal Format                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Definition          | "What is compound interest?"          | 40–60 word definition paragraph   |
| How-To              | "How do I set up 2FA?"                | Numbered steps                    |
| Comparison          | "AEO vs SEO — what's the difference?" | Table                             |
| Best/Recommendation | "Best project management tools"       | Ranked list with descriptions     |
| When/Why            | "Why is my Wi-Fi slow?"               | Short direct answer + explanation |
| Local               | "Dentists open Sunday in Brisbane"    | Local schema + NAP data           |

### Step 2: Answer-First Structure

Every major section should answer a specific question:

**H2 heading = the question**

```
## How Does AEO Differ from Traditional SEO?
```

**First 1–2 sentences = the direct answer**

```
AEO differs from SEO in its primary goal: where SEO aims to rank a page in
search results, AEO aims to have content selected as the direct answer —
bypassing the ranking list entirely.
```

**Remaining paragraphs = depth and context**

### Step 3: Featured Snippet Paragraphs

Target 40–60 words. Open by directly rephrasing the question. Give a complete, self-contained answer. Avoid first-person ("I", "we") and pronouns requiring context (say "AEO" not "it"). End with a full stop.

**Example:**

> **Question:** What is a featured snippet?
>
> **Optimised paragraph:** A featured snippet is a selected search result that Google displays at the top of the SERP in a special box, above all organic results. It is pulled directly from a web page and is designed to answer a user's question without requiring them to click through to the source. Featured snippets typically appear for question-based queries and can take the form of paragraphs, lists, or tables.

### Step 4: List-Optimised Content

Use `<ul>` or `<ol>` HTML tags. Keep list items concise (one line each is ideal). Introduce the list with a colon after a clear statement. Include 4–10 items (Google typically shows 4–8 in snippets). Don't rely purely on visual formatting — the context sentence matters.

### Step 5: Voice Search Optimisation

**Use conversational language.** Write how people speak. Instead of "optimal strategies for sleep improvement," write "how to sleep better."

**Target long-tail conversational queries.** "What's the cheapest way to fly from Sydney to London?" not "cheap Sydney London flights."

**Answer in 29 words or fewer** for voice. Google Assistant reads snippets aloud, and shorter answers perform better in voice SERP audits.

**Include Speakable schema** to explicitly flag which portions of your content are suitable for text-to-speech reading.

**Mark up your local data.** Voice searches are heavily local. Make sure your Google Business Profile is complete, your schema includes location data, and your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) is consistent across all citations.

### Step 6: FAQ Strategy

FAQ sections capture PAA boxes, feed AI Overviews, and allow FAQPage schema markup. Build 6–12 questions per page using real PAA and AnswerThePublic data. Each answer should be standalone and concise. Mark up every FAQ with FAQPage schema.

### Step 7: Knowledge Panels

To get or improve a knowledge panel:

- Create a Wikipedia article or Wikidata entry (for organisations or notable people)
- Claim your Google Business Profile
- Build consistent entity signals — ensure your name, description, and key facts are consistent across your website, social profiles, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, and press mentions
- Use `Organization`, `Person`, or `LocalBusiness` schema
- Link your social profiles in `sameAs` schema properties

## 7. GEO: Complete How-To Guide

### Step 1: Topical Authority Clusters

Generative engines heavily weight established authorities. Build a **pillar page** (3,000+ words) supported by cluster pages covering every sub-topic. Example structure:

```
Core Topic: "Cybersecurity for Small Business"
│
├── Pillar Page: Complete Guide to Cybersecurity for SMEs (3,000+ words)
│
├── Cluster Pages:
│   ├── What is a Firewall? (Definition + how-to)
│   ├── How to Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (Step-by-step)
│   ├── Best Password Managers for Small Teams (Comparison)
│   ├── How to Respond to a Data Breach (Emergency guide)
│   ├── Cybersecurity Compliance Checklist (Australia) (List)
│   ├── Common Phishing Attacks and How to Spot Them (Examples)
│   └── How Much Does a Cyberattack Cost an SME? (Data + stats)
│
└── All cluster pages link to pillar; pillar links to all cluster pages
```

When an LLM is asked about small business cybersecurity, your domain appearing repeatedly across retrieved content dramatically increases citation probability.

### Step 2: Statistics and Cited Data

Named, specific, current statistics with context. Example:

**Bad:** _Cyber attacks are very common among small businesses._

**Good:** _According to the Australian Cyber Security Centre's 2024 Annual Cyber Threat Report, cybercrime cost Australian organisations an estimated $33 billion in 2023–24, with small businesses accounting for 43% of all reported incidents._

What makes a good GEO statistic: named source, specific number, current year reference, contextualised meaning.

### Step 3: Expert Quotes

Include full name, title, and organisation. Make quotes specific and concrete, not platitudes. Provide context (conference, report, interview). A specific quote from a relevant mid-tier expert beats a vague quote from a famous one.

**Example format:**

> _"The biggest mistake SMEs make is treating cybersecurity as an IT issue rather than a business continuity issue,"_ says David Thodey, former CEO of Telstra, speaking at the 2024 AICD Cybersecurity Forum.

### Step 4: Comprehensiveness

Generative engines want to pull from one authoritative source where possible. Content that covers only one angle forces the LLM to pull from multiple sources — reducing your share of the citation.

**Comprehensiveness checklist for any topic page:**

- [ ] Definition of the core concept
- [ ] Historical context or origin
- [ ] How it works (mechanistically)
- [ ] Key components or variations
- [ ] Real-world examples or case studies
- [ ] Common misconceptions or myths
- [ ] Step-by-step implementation (if applicable)
- [ ] Pros and cons or limitations
- [ ] Expert perspectives
- [ ] Data and statistics
- [ ] FAQ section
- [ ] Related topics and next steps

### Step 5: Chunk-Friendly Structure

When a generative engine retrieves your page, it breaks it into segments of typically 200–500 tokens and ranks each chunk independently. **Every section must be independently useful and self-contained.**

- Start each H2/H3 section with a 1–2 sentence summary of what that section covers
- Don't rely on earlier context — each section should stand alone
- Avoid orphaned references ("as we discussed above...")
- Use descriptive headings that tell the reader (and the model) exactly what follows
- Keep paragraphs short — 3–5 sentences maximum

### Step 6: Authority Links

- Get cited in Wikipedia — heavily represented in LLM training data and retrieval indexes
- Earn .edu and .gov links
- Get featured in industry publications, trade press, and respected blogs
- Seek podcast/interview mentions — transcripts are crawled and indexed
- Publish original research — being the primary data source forces others to cite you

### Step 7: Brand Entity Optimisation

Generative AI systems think in terms of entities. Your brand, key employees, and products should all be clearly defined entities in the web's knowledge graph.

1. Create and maintain a Wikidata entry for your organisation
2. Claim and complete Google Knowledge Panel
3. Ensure consistent brand description across website, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, AngelList, and press mentions
4. Define key people — founders, executives — as named entities with consistent bios across platforms
5. Use `Organization` and `Person` schema with `sameAs` properties linking all profiles
6. Write an authoritative About page that defines your entity clearly

**UGC and Wikipedia Notability**

User-Generated Content plays a role in establishing Wikipedia notability indirectly. While UGC itself (social media posts, forum discussions, user reviews) isn't typically considered a reliable Wikipedia source, it can support notability by showcasing public interest and recognition.

How UGC contributes: high social engagement indicates widespread public interest; positive reviews on platforms like Google Reviews demonstrate market recognition; active forum participation (Reddit, Stack Overflow) highlights expertise; user testimonials build credibility and real-world application evidence.

Strategies to leverage UGC:

1. Feature user reviews and testimonials prominently on your website
2. Make content easily shareable to increase organic mentions and backlinks
3. Monitor brand mentions, sentiment, and coverage in UGC sources
4. Use UGC as a foundation to attract coverage from reliable sources — which is what Wikipedia actually requires
5. Avoid self-promotion pitfalls — focus on genuine, independent mentions rather than paid or orchestrated UGC

Among UGC sources, **Reddit** stands out for its massive user base and community-driven discussions. Authentic engagement in relevant subreddits can generate organic mentions that demonstrate community interest. However, Reddit threads are not reliable sources themselves; they serve as indicators of broader impact that can lead to coverage in more authoritative outlets.

### Step 8: Original Research

The single most powerful GEO tactic is creating content that cannot be found anywhere else. Original surveys, proprietary studies, and unique datasets force other content creators to cite you as the primary source.

**Ideas for original research:**

- Annual industry survey (even 100 respondents creates quotable data)
- Original analysis of publicly available datasets
- Case studies with specific, measurable outcomes
- Expert roundups with synthesised insights
- Benchmarking reports

## 8. Technical Optimisation

### Page Speed

- Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1
- TTFB: < 600ms
- Mobile PageSpeed score: 80+

### Crawlability

Ensure `robots.txt` does not block AI crawlers. Submit and maintain an up-to-date `sitemap.xml`. Use `hreflang` for multilingual sites. Resolve all broken internal links and redirect chains. Avoid heavy JavaScript rendering for key content — server-side rendering is preferred.

| Crawler               | User Agent                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| OpenAI (ChatGPT)      | `GPTBot`                     |
| Perplexity            | `PerplexityBot`              |
| Anthropic (Claude)    | `ClaudeBot` / `anthropic-ai` |
| Google (AI Overviews) | `Googlebot-Extended`         |
| Common Crawl          | `CCBot`                      |
| Meta                  | `FacebookBot`                |

### Content Freshness

Update the published/modified date when content is substantively refreshed. Add a "Last Updated: [Month Year]" notice prominently. Use `dateModified` in Article schema. Refresh statistics and data at least annually.

---

## 9. Schema Markup & Structured Data

Schema markup is the bridge between your content and machine-readable structure. It explicitly tells search engines and AI systems what your content is _about_, not just what it _says_.

### FAQPage Schema

}
```

## 10. E-E-A-T

Google's E-E-A-T framework (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is a proxy for the signals both traditional search and generative AI use to weight content.

### Experience

Has the author _done_ the thing they're writing about?

**Tactics:** Include case studies from your own work. Add personal anecdotes where relevant. Reference direct testing ("In our testing of 50 product pages..."). Show screenshots, results, or outcomes as evidence.

### Expertise

Does the author have demonstrable knowledge?

**Tactics:** Add author bios to every content piece — name, credentials, links to professional profiles. Use technical vocabulary correctly and confidently. Cite primary sources and peer-reviewed research. Link to your other expert content on the same topic.

### Authoritativeness

Is this source recognised as an authority by others?

**Tactics:** Earn backlinks from respected industry sources. Get mentioned or quoted in trade press. Build a recognisable brand on social/professional platforms. Contribute expert quotes to others' content (they'll link back).

### Trustworthiness

Is the content honest, accurate, and safe?

**Tactics:** Show your sources — link out to primary data. Include dates and version notes. Disclose affiliations and conflicts of interest. Have a clear, comprehensive About page. Display trust signals: privacy policy, terms, contact details. Use HTTPS.

---

## 11. Prompt Engineering for Your Content

When an LLM retrieves your page and reads it, it is essentially processing your text as input context. The clearer, more structured, and more answerable your text is, the better the model can extract value from it.

**Write "Context-Complete" Sections:** Every chunk of your content should contain sufficient context to generate a useful answer. Ask yourself: _If I gave this paragraph — and only this paragraph — to ChatGPT, could it answer a question from this text alone?_

**Use Explicit Definitional Language:** LLMs latch onto definitional sentences — statements of the form "X is Y." Use them liberally:

**Reinforce Your Entity in Context:** Mention your brand name, core expertise, and key claims naturally throughout content — contextually embedded, not stuffed. When an LLM encounters your brand repeatedly in the context of authoritative, accurate claims, it reinforces entity associations.

## 12. Tracking & Measuring Performance

### AEO Metrics

| Metric                      | What it Measures                                         | Tool                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Featured Snippet wins       | How often you appear in snippet position                 | Semrush, Ahrefs               |
| PAA appearances             | Presence in People Also Ask boxes                        | AlsoAsked, SERPWatcher        |
| Zero-click impression share | Impressions without clicks (indicating snippet presence) | Google Search Console         |
| Voice search rankings       | Rank for conversational queries                          | SEMrush Voice                 |
| AI Overview appearances     | Whether you're cited in Google AI Overviews              | Manual checks, emerging tools |
| Rich result types           | HowTo, FAQ, etc. in SERP                                 | Google Rich Results Test      |

### GEO Metrics

| Metric                     | What it Measures                                    | Tool                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| AI citation frequency      | How often you're cited by Perplexity, ChatGPT, etc. | Manual spot-checks, AirOps |
| Brand mention volume in AI | How often your brand appears in AI answers          | Mention tracking tools     |
| Share of AI voice          | Your citations vs. competitors'                     | Competitive monitoring     |
| Topical coverage           | Questions on your topic you're cited for            | Manual testing             |
| LLM brand familiarity      | Does the model "know" your brand?                   | Prompt testing             |

### Practical GEO Monitoring Process

1. Define a set of 20–50 target queries — the most important questions in your niche
2. Test each query weekly in Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, and Google AI Overviews
3. Record whether you're cited, mentioned, or absent for each
4. Track trends over time — is your citation rate improving?
5. Analyse which content types get cited most often (guides vs. data pieces vs. definitions)
6. Test competitor queries to understand what's working for peers

## 14. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Treating AEO/GEO as separate from SEO** — they require a solid SEO foundation
- **Targeting keywords instead of questions** — "cybersecurity tips" vs "How can a small business improve cybersecurity without a large IT budget?"
- **Writing flowing paragraphs instead of chunks** — beautiful prose is terrible for AI retrieval
- **Ignoring entity signals** — an AI that doesn't know who you are won't cite you as an authority
- **Vague, passive language** — "It is generally believed that..." signals low-confidence content; AI systems prefer specific, attributed claims
- **No update strategy** — AI systems prefer fresh content; build a refresh calendar for your most important pages
- **Blocking AI crawlers** — review your `robots.txt` intentionally; many WordPress plugins aggressively block all bots
- **Expecting overnight results** — GEO operates on longer cycles; retrieval-based systems (Perplexity) respond faster; base model training changes slower

---

## 15. The Future of AEO & GEO

### Agentic AI

AI agents (like Operator from OpenAI, or Copilot agents from Microsoft) browse the web, fill forms, make bookings, and complete multi-step workflows autonomously. For AEO/GEO practitioners: action schema will become critical, API-accessible data will be favoured over HTML pages, and trust signals become existential.

### Personalised AI Search

As AI systems become more personalised, brand loyalty signals, citation history, and user-specific relevance will increasingly influence which sources AI cites for a given individual.

### Multimodal AI Search

Future GEO will require optimised alt text and image descriptions for visual AI, transcripts and structured metadata for video content, and podcast episode notes and transcripts for audio content.

### Regulatory and Transparency Changes

Emerging AI transparency regulations (particularly in the EU under the AI Act) may require AI search systems to disclose sources more prominently — potentially increasing the brand visibility value of AI citations.

## 21. User Personas Examples:

### Persona 1: The Agency Director

- **Role:** Head of Digital at a 40-person agency managing 60+ client accounts
- **Pain:** Manually checking AI answers for each client is impossible at scale. Clients ask "are we in ChatGPT?" and there's no good answer.
- **Needs:** White-labelled client reporting, bulk monitoring, ROI dashboards, alerts
- **Willing to pay:** $500–$2,000/month

### Persona 2: The In-House SEO Lead

- **Role:** Senior SEO Manager at a mid-size e-commerce brand
- **Pain:** Knows AI search is important but has no tooling. Justifying investment to the CMO requires data she can't produce.
- **Needs:** GEO score benchmarking, content gap analysis, automated briefs
- **Willing to pay:** $200–$600/month

### Persona 3: The Enterprise Content Strategist

- **Role:** VP Content at a Fortune 500 financial services firm
- **Pain:** Compliance requires knowing exactly where brand messaging appears. AI citations are ungoverned. Competitor AI mentions are eating their share.
- **Needs:** Enterprise governance, brand entity monitoring, competitor tracking, API access
- **Willing to pay:** $2,000–$10,000/month

# Application

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

When you first log in, you create a **project** for your website.

- Enter your domain (e.g. `mybusiness.com.au`)
- Type in the questions your customers ask — e.g. _"best CRM for small business"_, _"how to treat a burn at home"_. These are called **tracked queries**.
- Choose which AI engines to watch — Perplexity, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot
- Set how often you want the platform to check — weekly, daily, or every 6 hours

---

## Step 2: Collect Business Intelligence

Once you collect the name and website of the business, the platform automatically gathers information relevant to SEO, GEO, and AEO optimization.

**Competitor Analysis** — identifies your main competitors in the space by analyzing who ranks for your tracked queries and who gets cited in AI answers.

**Top Search Terms Discovery** — finds the most searched questions and keywords in your domain using data from Google Trends, AnswerThePublic, and AI search patterns.

**Current Rankings Assessment** — checks your current SEO rankings, AEO wins (featured snippets, PAA), and GEO citations across all major AI engines for the identified terms.

This intelligence forms the baseline for your optimization strategy and helps prioritize which queries to focus on first.

---

## Step 3: Run Your First Audits

Before optimising anything, the platform checks what's broken or blocked right now.

**AI Crawler Audit** — checks your `robots.txt` file to see if you're accidentally blocking AI bots like ChatGPT's crawler or Google's AI crawler from reading your site. If they can't crawl you, they can't cite you.

**Technical SEO Audit** — checks your site speed, broken links, sitemap, and mobile performance. These are the foundations everything else sits on.

**Content Audit** — paste in a URL from your website. The platform reads the page and gives it an AEO score and a GEO score, telling you exactly what's missing.

---

## Step 4: Check Your Visibility

This is your ongoing monitoring — the platform runs automatically in the background.

**GEO Tracker** — for each of your tracked queries, it goes and asks ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Copilot the question. It checks: _did they cite your website in the answer?_ It logs whether you were cited, what position you were in, and which engines cited you.

**AEO Manager** — checks Google Search for each query. Did you win the featured snippet (the box at the top)? Did you appear in the "People Also Ask" boxes? Did Google's AI Overview cite you?

**SEO Rank Tracker** — standard keyword ranking. Where do you appear in Google's organic results for each query?

**Voice Search Tracker** — for voice-style queries (e.g. _"what's the best way to..."_), checks whether your answer is the one a smart speaker would read out.

---

## Step 5: Read Your Scores

The platform turns all that monitoring into three simple numbers on your dashboard.

| Score                              | What it means                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GEO Visibility Score™ (0–100)** | How often you're cited across all AI engines. 0 = invisible, 100 = dominant. |
| **AEO Win Rate**                   | % of tracked queries where you own the featured snippet or PAA box.          |
| **SEO Visibility Score**           | How well you rank organically across all tracked queries.                    |
| **Competitor AI Share**            | Of all AI citations for your queries, what % go to you vs competitors.       |

---

## Step 6: Fix and Optimise Your Content

Now you know the gaps — here's how you fix them.

**Content Optimiser** — paste in a page URL. It scores the page across 6 dimensions:

- Does it have a direct answer up front?
- Does it have schema markup?
- Does it cover all the sub-questions?
- Does it have stats and citations?

It tells you exactly what to fix and by how much.

**AI Brief Generator** — if you need to write a new page, this generates a full content brief structured specifically for AI citation — with suggested headings, questions to answer, stats to find, and FAQ questions to include.

**FAQ Auto-Generator** — pulls real "People Also Ask" questions from Google for your topic and turns them into a ready-to-publish FAQ section with suggested answers.

**Schema Builder** — auto-generates the invisible code (called schema markup) that tells Google and AI systems exactly what your content is. It produces the code and lets you test it instantly with Google's own testing tool. You then paste it into your website or CMS.

---

## Step 7: Act on Alerts

You don't need to log in every day. The platform watches for you and tells you when something important happens.

| Alert Level           | Triggers                                                                                  | Channel       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 🔴 **Immediate**      | Competitor stole your snippet, you dropped from an AI answer, AI bot blocked on your site | Slack + Email |
| 🟡 **Daily Digest**   | Moderate changes worth knowing about                                                      | Email         |
| 🟢 **Weekly Summary** | General trends, wins, and progress                                                        | Email         |

---

## Step 8: Report to Clients or Management

Once you have data, you can share it.

**White-label Reports** — if you're an agency, generate branded PDF reports for each client showing their GEO Score, AEO wins, and SEO visibility. Your logo, not aeo-app.ai's.

**Executive Dashboard** — a single-screen view of all three scores with trend lines. Built for showing a CMO or CEO at a glance.

**Export options:**

- Google Sheets
- Looker Studio
- BigQuery
- API (for custom integrations)
