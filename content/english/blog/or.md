## Day 1: What is Optimization?

### Introduction

Optimization is the process of finding the **best solution** from all feasible solutions. It's about making the most effective use of limited resources to achieve your goals.

### Core Concepts

**Definition**: Optimization is the mathematical discipline of finding the maximum or minimum value of a function subject to constraints.

**Key Components:**
1. **Objective Function** - What you want to maximize or minimize
2. **Decision Variables** - What you can control or change
3. **Constraints** - Limitations or requirements you must satisfy
4. **Feasible Region** - All solutions that satisfy the constraints
5. **Optimal Solution** - The best feasible solution

### Types of Optimization Problems

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Linear Programming** | Objective and constraints are all linear | Production planning, resource allocation |
| **Integer Programming** | Some/all variables must be integers | Scheduling, yes/no decisions |
| **Nonlinear Programming** | Objective or constraints are nonlinear | Portfolio optimization, engineering design |
| **Combinatorial Optimization** | Selecting from discrete options | Traveling salesman, graph problems |
| **Stochastic Optimization** | Involves uncertainty/randomness | Inventory under demand uncertainty |
| **Multi-objective Optimization** | Multiple competing objectives | Cost vs quality vs time trade-offs |

### Real-World Examples

#### Example 1: Manufacturing (Profit Maximization)
Problem: A factory makes chairs and tables

Chairs sell for $50, tables for $80
Limited wood, labor, and machine time
Question: How many of each to make to maximize profit?

Components:

Decision Variables: Number of chairs, number of tables
Objective: Maximize total profit
Constraints: Wood availability, labor hours, machine capacity

#### Example 2: Diet Planning (Cost Minimization)
Problem: Create a meal plan that meets nutritional needs

Different foods have different costs and nutrients
Must meet minimum daily requirements for protein, vitamins, etc.
Question: What to eat to minimize cost while staying healthy?

Components:

Decision Variables: Amount of each food to consume
Objective: Minimize total cost
Constraints: Minimum nutrition requirements

#### Example 3: Route Planning (Distance Minimization)
Problem: Deliver packages to 20 locations

Must visit each location exactly once
Return to starting point
Question: What order minimizes total distance?

Components:

Decision Variables: Order of visiting locations
Objective: Minimize total distance traveled
Constraints: Visit each location once, return to start

### Optimization vs Other Problem-Solving

| Approach | Goal | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Simulation** | Understand what happens | "If we make 100 chairs, what's our profit?" |
| **Optimization** | Find the best option | "How many chairs maximize profit?" |
| **Machine Learning** | Learn patterns from data | "Predict tomorrow's demand" |
| **Optimization + ML** | Best decision using predictions | "Optimal inventory given demand forecast" |

### Why Optimization Matters

**Business Impact:**
- Walmart saves **$12 billion annually** through supply chain optimization
- Airlines save **millions in fuel costs** through route optimization
- Hospitals reduce **waiting times by 30-50%** through scheduling optimization

**Everyday Impact:**
- Google Maps finds your fastest route (optimization)
- Netflix recommends shows (optimization + ML)
- Your phone's battery lasts longer (power optimization)
- Online prices adjust based on demand (revenue optimization)

### Mathematical Notation Preview

Don't worry if this looks intimidating - we'll build up to it:
Maximize:   f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)           ← Objective function
Subject to: g₁(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) ≤ b₁     ← Constraint 1
g₂(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) ≤ b₂     ← Constraint 2
...
xᵢ ≥ 0                        ← Non-negativity


## Day 2: Linear Algebra Basics

### Why Linear Algebra for Optimization?

Optimization problems are fundamentally about:
- Multiple variables interacting together
- Systems of equations and inequalities
- Geometric spaces and directions

Linear algebra gives us the language and tools to work with these efficiently.

### Vectors

**Definition**: A vector is an ordered list of numbers.

**Notation**:
- Column vector: **x** = [x₁, x₂, x₃]ᵀ
- Row vector: **x** = [x₁, x₂, x₃]

**Examples:**
Production quantities: x = [chairs=10, tables=5]
Location coordinates: p = [latitude=40.7, longitude=-74.0]
Resource usage: r = [wood=50, labor=30, money=1000]

**Vector Operations:**

1. **Addition**: Add corresponding components
[2]   [5]   [7]
[3] + [1] = [4]

2. **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiply each component by a number
   [2]   [6]
3 × [4] = [12]
[1]   [3]

3. **Dot Product**: Multiply corresponding components and sum
[2, 3, 1] · [4, 1, 2] = 2×4 + 3×1 + 1×2 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13

**Geometric Interpretation:**
- Vector = arrow in space
- Addition = placing arrows tip-to-tail
- Dot product = measures "alignment" between vectors

### Matrices

**Definition**: A rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

**Notation**:
 [a₁₁  a₁₂  a₁₃]
A =  [a₂₁  a₂₂  a₂₃]

**Dimensions**: m × n (m rows, n columns)

**Examples in Optimization:**

**Resource Usage Matrix:**
    Wood  Labor  Cost
Chair  [ 2     3      20 ]
Table  [ 4     2      35 ]
Desk   [ 5     4      50 ]

**Constraint Coefficients:**
2x₁ + 4x₂ + 5x₃ ≤ 100  (wood constraint)
3x₁ + 2x₂ + 4x₃ ≤ 80   (labor constraint)
Can be written as: Ax ≤ b
 [2  4  5]       [100]
A =  [3  2  4],  b = [80]

### Matrix Operations

**1. Matrix-Vector Multiplication:**
[2  3] [x₁]   [2x₁ + 3x₂]
[1  4] [x₂] = [1x₁ + 4x₂]

**Interpretation**: Applying constraints
- Each row represents one constraint
- Multiply coefficients by variable values

**Example:**
If we make x₁=10 chairs and x₂=5 tables:
[2  4] [10]   [2(10) + 4(5)]   [40]   ← Total wood used
[3  2] [5]  = [3(10) + 2(5)] = [40]   ← Total labor used

**2. Matrix Addition**: Add corresponding elements
[1  2]   [5  6]   [6   8]
[3  4] + [7  8] = [10  12]

**3. Matrix Multiplication**: More complex, less commonly needed initially
[a  b] [e  f]   [ae+bg  af+bh]
[c  d] [g  h] = [ce+dg  cf+dh]

### Linear Combinations

**Definition**: A sum of vectors, each multiplied by a scalar.
Result = c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + ... + cₙvₙ

**Example:**
Make 3 chairs and 2 tables
Resources needed = 3 × [chair resources] + 2 × [table resources]
                [2]       [4]       [14]
            = 3 [3]  + 2  [2]   =   [13]  ← Total resources
                [20]      [35]      [130]

**This is the foundation of optimization!**
- Variables (x₁, x₂, ...) are the scalars
- Resource vectors are combined
- We want the best combination

### Systems of Linear Equations

**Standard Form:**
a₁₁x₁ + a₁₂x₂ = b₁
a₂₁x₁ + a₂₂x₂ = b₂

**Matrix Form:**
Ax = b

**Example:**
2x₁ + 3x₂ = 13
1x₁ + 4x₂ = 14
Solution: x₁ = 2, x₂ = 3 (verify by substituting!)

**Types of Solutions:**
1. **Unique solution**: Exactly one answer (most common)
2. **Infinite solutions**: Many possible answers
3. **No solution**: Inconsistent system

### Inequalities in Optimization

**Most constraints are inequalities, not equations:**
2x₁ + 3x₂ ≤ 100   (can't use more than 100 units)
x₁ ≥ 0            (can't make negative chairs)

**Key difference from equations:**
- Equation: Must be exactly equal
- Inequality: Can be less than (or greater than) the limit

### Practical Tips

**Don't memorize, understand:**
- Vectors = lists of related numbers
- Matrix multiplication = applying transformations
- Systems of equations = finding where things balance

**Optimization connection:**
- Variables = what we decide
- Matrix = how variables use resources
- Vector = resource limits
- Find variable values that work best
