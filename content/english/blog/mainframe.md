## Introduction

This document provides a **detailed, step-by-step plan** for migrating a large Mainframe (COBOL) project to Java using AI, specifically leveraging the Bedrock Claude 4.5 Sonnet model. It is tailored for developers familiar with Python, Java, and JavaScript, but new to COBOL.

---

## 1. Assessment & Preparation

- **Inventory Mainframe Assets**
  - List all COBOL programs, JCL scripts, copybooks, datasets, and utilities.
  - Identify external dependencies (databases, files, batch jobs, CICS transactions).
  - Gather all available documentation and business process flows.

- **Set Up Your Environment**
  - Provision a Linux server or cloud VM with Python, Java, Node.js, and Docker.
  - Install tools: `git`, `python3`, `pip`, `open-cobol` (GnuCOBOL), and a code editor (VS Code recommended).
---

## 2. Parsing & Code Structure Graph Construction

- **Parsing COBOL Code**
  - Use open-source parsers like [cobol-parser](https://github.com/uwol/cobol-parser) (Node.js) or [cobol2json](https://github.com/kevinreedy/cobol2json) (Python).
  - Parse each COBOL file to extract:
    - Program name, called subprograms, copybooks used.
    - Data structures (variables, records), file I/O, SQL statements.

- **Building the Graph**
  - Use [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) (graph database) to store relationships:
    - Nodes: Programs, copybooks, datasets, jobs.
    - Edges: "calls", "uses", "reads", "writes", "includes".
  - Example (Python with Neo4j driver):
    ```python
    from neo4j import GraphDatabase
    driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))
    with driver.session() as session:
        session.run("CREATE (p:Program {name: 'PAYROLL'})")
        session.run("CREATE (c:Copybook {name: 'EMPLOYEE-REC'})")
        session.run("MATCH (p:Program {name: 'PAYROLL'}), (c:Copybook {name: 'EMPLOYEE-REC'}) "
                    "CREATE (p)-[:USES]->(c)")
    ```

## 3. Knowledge Base Creation

- **Document Linking**
  - For each node in the graph, attach:
    - Source code (as text or file reference).
    - Extracted comments and documentation.
    - Business rules (from comments or external docs).

- **Semantic Enrichment**
  - Use NLP (with Bedrock Claude 4.5 Sonnet) to summarize code sections, extract business logic, and generate human-readable descriptions.
  - Example prompt for Claude:
    ```
    "Summarize the business logic of this COBOL program:\n{COBOL_CODE}"
    ```

- **Indexing**
  - Use [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) to index code, comments, and documentation for fast search.

## 4. AI-Assisted Migration (COBOL to Java)

- **Translation Workflow**
  1. **Extract**: For each COBOL program, extract logic, data structures, and I/O.
  2. **Prompt Engineering**: Feed code and context to Claude 4.5 Sonnet with clear instructions, e.g.:
     ```
     "Convert this COBOL program to idiomatic Java. Explain any mainframe-specific logic in comments."
     ```
  3. **Review & Refactor**: Manually review AI-generated Java code, refactor for clarity and maintainability.
  4. **Automated Testing**: Write unit tests in Java to match COBOL program outputs.

- **Tips for Non-COBOL Developers**
  - Map COBOL data types to Java types (e.g., `PIC 9(5)` → `int`).
  - Batch processing in COBOL often maps to Java streams or Spring Batch.
  - File I/O: COBOL sequential files → Java `BufferedReader`/`BufferedWriter`.

---

## 5. Chatbot Integration

- **Expose the Knowledge Graph**
  - Build a REST API (Python Flask or Node.js Express) to query the Neo4j graph and Elasticsearch index.

- **Connect Bedrock Claude 4.5 Sonnet**
  - Use AWS SDK or Bedrock API to send user queries and code snippets to Claude.
  - Example: User asks, "What does the PAYROLL program do?" → API fetches code, sends to Claude for summary.

- **Build a Chatbot UI**
  - Use React or Angular for frontend.
  - Integrate with your backend API and Bedrock Claude for interactive Q&A.

---

## 6. Iterative Migration & Feedback

- **Start Small**
  - Select a simple COBOL program, migrate, and validate.
  - Use feedback to improve parsing, translation prompts, and chatbot answers.

- **Scale Gradually**
  - Migrate more complex programs, update the knowledge graph, and expand chatbot capabilities.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Continuous Improvement

- **Track Progress**
  - Use dashboards to monitor migration status, code quality, and chatbot usage.

- **Retrain & Refine**
  - Periodically update AI prompts and retrain models with new examples and feedback.

### Risks & Mitigations

- **Incomplete Parsing**: Validate with SMEs, improve parsers iteratively.
- **Loss of Business Logic**: Use AI to extract intent, always review with business analysts.
- **Performance**: Optimize graph queries, use distributed processing for large codebases.

## Key Concepts & Terminology
- **COBOL Basics for Non-COBOL Developers**
  - COBOL is a procedural, English-like language, often used for batch and transaction processing.
  - Key concepts:
    - **Division**: Four main sections—IDENTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENT, DATA, PROCEDURE.
    - **Copybooks**: Like Java includes or Python imports, used for code/data reuse.
    - **JCL**: Job Control Language, scripts to run COBOL jobs on mainframes.
  - **COBOL programs**: Source code files written in COBOL, similar to `.java` or `.py` files, containing business logic and data processing.
  - **JCL scripts**: Job Control Language scripts, like shell scripts or batch files, used to run and schedule COBOL programs on the mainframe.
  - **Copybooks**: Reusable code or data structure snippets, similar to Java imports or Python modules, often used for shared data definitions.
  - **Datasets**: Files or databases on the mainframe, used to store input/output data, like CSV files or SQL tables.
  - **Utilities**: System tools or programs for tasks like file copying, sorting, or data conversion, similar to Unix command-line utilities (e.g., `cp`, `sort`).
